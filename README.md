# KaseiCoin ERC-20 fungible token  .

## Overview of the project 

Creating a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and that will be minted by using a Crowdsale contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

The crowdsale contract is managing the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KAI, or KaseiCoin tokens. Your contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.



## Project steps 

The steps for this Challenge are divided into the following sections:

    1. Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract

    3. Create the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract

    4. Deploy the Crowdsale to a Local Blockchain


##### Deploy the crowdsale to a local blockchain with Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache.

##### Test the functionality of the crowdsale by using test accounts to buy new tokens and then checking the balances associated with those accounts.

##### After purchasing tokens with one or more test accounts, view the total supply of minted tokens and the amount of wei that has been raised in the crowdsale contract.

    5. Record a short video or take several screenshots that show the deployed contract in action.

    6. Optional: Use OpenZeppelin to extend the functionality of your crowdsale contract 
    by adding time restrictions, refund capabilities, and a cap for the number of tokens that may be created.
